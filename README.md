# Finite State Machine Godot
In this guide, you will learn how to create a Finite State Machine (FSM) in Godot 4. We’ll talk about the problem this pattern tries to solve and see two ways to implement it: using a simple variable and functions, and using nodes for a visual representation.

You’ll learn:
- What a Finite State Machine is and when to use it in games.
- What problem the pattern helps solve.
- How to implement a Finite State Machine in Godot with a simple variable, if statements, and functions.
- How to implement a more complex FSM with nodes.
- When to use either implementation.
- What are the benefits and drawbacks of using a state machine.
